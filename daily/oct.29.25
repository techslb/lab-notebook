### Lab Notebook Entry [2025-10-29]

## Focus/Objective
1. Continue basic IT learning for A+ concepts.
2. Continue learning and apllying Java programming concepts.
3. Continue learning math foundations.

## Context/Setup
1. Professor Messer A+ learning videos for IT.
2. Codecademy Java OOP course for Java concepts.
3. Khan Academy math vdieos for math foundations.
4. TryHackMe for security groundwork.

## Actions/Procedures
1. Reviewed all notes and flashcards for IT and Java.
2. Completed a Java project for a toy droid project and uploaded to Github
3. Watched a new IT video from Professor Messer's Youtube channle and took notes.
4. Watched a new Khan Academy video, took notes, and completed the required exercises.
5. Completed the Intro to Offensive Security lab on TryHackMe as part of the pre-security training path.

## Observations
1. I am incredibly rusty with problem solving with Java. Had an issue with direct object to object interactions and manipulation.
2. Math and IT learnings today felt unchallenging but needed as Java took more attention today.

## Analysis/Interpretation
1. Still a novice in Java, therefore it is expected I run into issues as I am learning.

## Next Steps/Questions
1. Continue applying concepts, working through platforms, especially with Java, and reviewing flashcards daily.
2. How do i perform object to object manipulation in OOP Java?

## Reflection
1. Was frustrated with Java today, but after typing this journal I have to remember that I am still considered a novice, and mistakes are apart of the process.
2. I forgot that you don't 'double-dip' with a void method and calling one, for example:

>>> myDroid.batteryStatus(); // Correct

as opposed to:

>>> System.out.println(myDroid.batteryStatus());

This caused about 10 minutes of debugging and confusion but realized the method was void, and a printed message was already defined in my class method definition. Hence the term, 'double-dipping'.
